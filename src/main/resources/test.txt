Jingle Bells

by James Lord Pierpont

Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh,
Over the fields we go,
Laughing all the way;
The bells on bob-tail ring,
They make our spirits bright,
What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight, O


Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh


A day or two ago,
I thought I’d take a ride,
And soon Miss Fanny Bright
Was seated by my side;
The horse was lean and lank;
Misfortune seemed his lot;
He got into a drifted bank,
And we, we got upset. O


Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh


Now the ground is white
So go it while you’re young,
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bob-tailed nag
Two-forty for his speed
Then hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you’ll take the lead, O



Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells,
Jingle all the way!
O what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
